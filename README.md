## Overview of analysis
- This visualization represents Citi Bike data from New York City during August of 2019. It will be utilized to draw conclusions as to if 
a bike sharing buisness would be viable for a similar buisness stationed in Des Moines.

- Despite gender, trips are mostly under 1 hour.
- It can be assumed that because of peak hours, most trips occur during work commutes.
- On weekends the majority of trips occur during the day rather than in the morning/evening.

- Based on our gender filtered heatmap you can see the majority of our users are male.
- We can also that conclude that while we do see some ordinary customer use, largely our bikes 
are used by subscribers.
- Peak time during the week are 7am-9am and 5pm-6pm

- Start and end locations are very similar but display our busiest areas

## Summary
- There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis 

- The numbers show that this service is quite popular, at least during August of 2019
- Most trips were made by males during busy commuting hours
- This alternative transportation offers a healthier and cheaper alternative to many other options 
and its popularity speaks for itself
